## Background

With the rise of generative AI, I saw an opportunity to improve upon the existing UI of AI tools. I began by brainstorming what I used ChatGPT the most for. As a student, I use ChatGPT for its capabilities in summarizing content but found its UI lacking. This led to my creation of Sumz.ai, combining the robust capabilities of GPT-4 with a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

## Notes

This project marks my first integration of OpenAI's API into a web app. Furthermore, it marks the foundation for some of my future projects that I plan on using generative AI to enhance user productivity.
